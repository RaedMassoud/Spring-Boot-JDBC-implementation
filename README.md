# Spring-Boot-JDBC-implementation
This project uses the MVC design pattern and serves as hands-on experience in utilizing the Spring Boot framework, JDBC API, H2 database, and JdbcTemplate class
for database operations in a minimalistic yet effective manner.
I created a single "person" table with 4 attributes (id, first name, last name, city).
The implementation covers essential CRUD functionalities such as: Adding people / Deleting people / fetching data.
In addition to fetching data by city.
